# Employee Attrition

# Introduction

## Research Paper on Employee Attrition

I recently went through an research paper on [employee attrition](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1461317/FULLTEXT01.pdf). Here are few highlights I could capture. 

### Few keypoints

- **Employee satisfaction is inversely related to Attrition.**


- **Effect of Attrition on a company.**
    - Negative effect on producticity.
    - Knowledge loss, gone with the employee.
    - Increase in workload for remaining employees.
    - Negative impact on companies morale.
    - More expense on process for hiring and training new employess.
    

- **Why employess leave job(internal reasons)?**
    - Disatisfaction
    - No-commitment to the company


- **Factors affecting satisfaction(internal).**
    - Connectedness to others 
    - Feeling of belonging somewhere.
    - Feeling of support from organization.
    - Resonable workload.
    
    
- **Using ML in HRM (Human Resource Management).**
    - Small data, and sometimes not even recorded.
    - Decision made by HR have heavy consequences.
    - Measuring performace is hard, depends on teamwork. And individual performance is difficult to extract from teams performance.
    - Hiring/Firing is not only based on tangible reasons but also on psychological relations between employees.
    - ML algorithms can be biased and can not take into account of everything about future employees for instance race can cause bias. *Author also gives example of Amazon removing gender column to remove biases.*
        

**ML Model Interpreteability**

Local: Relation between prediction and small subsets of data.

Global: Relation between prediction and large segment of data. 

Global helps to understand how the model works as a whole. Local can be more descriptive of how model is performing.

As far as the ML alorigthms, author has used SVM, Logistic Regression and Random forest and did comparision between them. 

(*Again these all info's are something I took as a note from the research paper I mentioned above and not my work.*)
